# Clipborg

A lightweight clipboard history manager for macOS. Clipborg lives in your menu
bar, quietly records what you copy, and lets you search back through it and paste
any earlier entry from a fast, keyboard-driven panel.

## Features

- **Menu bar resident** — runs as a background accessory (`LSUIElement`), no Dock
  icon, no window cluttering your screen.
- **Captures text, images, and files** — records plain text, images (e.g. copied
  from Preview or a browser), and file URLs (files copied in Finder).
- **Search-first history panel** — a floating, centered panel with a search field
  that matches across text content, file names, and the source app name.
- **Fully keyboard-driven** — open with a global shortcut, type to filter, and
  navigate without touching the mouse:
  - `↑` / `↓` or `Ctrl-P` / `Ctrl-N` — move the selection
  - `Return` — paste the highlighted item into the app you were just using
    (or copy it, if auto-paste is off or unavailable)
  - `Esc` — dismiss the panel (it also closes when it loses focus)
- **Auto-paste** — `Return` pastes the selection straight into the previously
  focused app by synthesizing a `⌘V`, so you don't have to switch back and paste
  manually. On by default; it needs Accessibility permission (Clipborg requests
  it when you enable the toggle) and gracefully falls back to copy-only without it.
- **Source app tracking** — each entry remembers (and shows the icon of) the app
  it was copied from. The origin is preserved when you re-select an old item.
- **Configurable global shortcut** — record any modifier + key combo in Settings
  to summon the panel from anywhere.
- **Password-manager aware** — respects the
  [nspasteboard.org](http://nspasteboard.org) convention and skips clipboard
  contents marked concealed, transient, or auto-generated.
- **Persistent & deduplicated** — history is stored locally in SQLite and
  survives restarts. Duplicate copies move to the top instead of piling up; the
  store is capped at 10,000 items.

## Requirements

- macOS 14 (Sonoma) or later
- Swift 6 toolchain (Xcode 16+) to build
- [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) for `make lint`

## Building & Running

The project uses a `Makefile` for common tasks:

```sh
make run     # build a proper .app bundle (icon, menu bar agent, signed) and open it
make app     # build the .app bundle without launching it
make build   # plain `swift build`
make test    # run the test suite
make lint    # run SwiftLint
make clean   # clean build artifacts
```

`make run` assembles a real `.app` bundle so the menu bar agent, icon, and code
signature are in place. Because persistence is SQLite (via
[GRDB](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift)) rather than something requiring a
bundle identifier, plain `swift run` also works for day-to-day development.

Accessibility grants (needed for auto-paste) are tied to the app's code-signing
identity. The `Makefile` auto-detects a real signing identity from your keychain
and signs with it, so the grant persists across rebuilds; it falls back to ad-hoc
signing if none is found (in which case macOS forgets the grant on every rebuild).
Override explicitly with `make run CODESIGN_IDENTITY=<identity>` if needed.

## Usage

1. Launch Clipborg — a clipboard icon (`doc.on.clipboard`) appears in the menu bar.
   On first launch the Settings window opens automatically.
2. Record a **Global Shortcut**. To use auto-paste, leave **Paste into the active
   app on Return** enabled and grant **Accessibility** access when prompted
   (Clipborg links you to the right System Settings pane).
3. Copy things as you normally would; Clipborg records them in the background.
4. Press your shortcut (or choose **Show History** from the menu) to open the
   panel, type to search, select an entry, and press `Return` — it pastes into
   the app you came from (or just copies, if auto-paste is off/ungranted).

Your history is stored at:

```
~/Library/Application Support/clipborg/history.sqlite
```

## Architecture

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `ClipborgApp.swift` | App entry point and `AppDelegate` — wires up the status item, watcher, panel, hotkey, and store. |
| `ClipboardWatcher.swift` | Polls `NSPasteboard` `changeCount` and reports new contents. |
| `ClipboardHistory.swift` | Observable history model with dedup and size cap; `ClipItem` / `ClipContent` types. |
| `ClipStore.swift` | `ClipStore` persistence protocol and the GRDB/SQLite implementation. |
| `HistoryViewModel.swift` | Drives the panel's search + keyboard selection. |
| `Panel.swift` | The floating panel window and its key-handling. |
| `MenuContent.swift` | SwiftUI content of the history panel. |
| `SettingsView.swift` | Settings UI — shortcut recorder and the auto-paste toggle. |
| `AppSettings.swift` | Persisted settings and shortcut formatting. |
| `HotkeyManager.swift` | Registers/unregisters the global hotkey. |
| `Paster.swift` | Accessibility trust check/request and `⌘V` synthesis for auto-paste. |

The persistence layer is kept behind the narrow `ClipStore` protocol so
`ClipboardHistory` can be tested against an in-memory SQLite store
(`SQLiteClipStore.inMemory()`). Tests live in `Tests/clipborgTests/`.

- Swift 6 + SwiftUI + AppKit
